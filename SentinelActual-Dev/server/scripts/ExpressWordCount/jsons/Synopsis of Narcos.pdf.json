The show chronicles \nthe main events that happened in Colombia during this period and Escobar's relationship to \nthem. It is told through the perspective of Steve Murphy, an American DEA agent working in \nColombia. \nThe initial episodes start at the year of 1973 in Chile, with Mateo \"Cockroach\" Moreno, \na Chilean drug dealer and underground chemist in a secret cocaine lab in the Atacama Desert, is \ndiscovered by the Chilean Armed Forces and his cartel members are completely executed, but \nMateo surprisingly survives, in which later he manages to escape to Colombia. It is followed with \nthe show how Escobar first became involved in the cocaine trade in Colombia. He was an \nestablished black marketeer in Medellín, moving trucks worth of illegal goods (alcohol, cigarettes, \nand household appliances) into Colombia during a time when this was strictly forbidden, when \nintroduced to Mateo, who pitched the idea that they go into business together, with Moreno \nproducing and Escobar distributing a new, profitable drug — cocaine. They expand beyond \nMoreno's small cocaine processing lab by building additional, larger labs in the rainforest and, \nusing the expertise of Carlos Lehder, transport their product in bulk to Miami, where it gains \nnotoriety amongst the rich and famous. Soon enough, Pablo develops larger labs and more \nextensive distribution routes into the US to supply growing demand. W ith cocaine's growth into a \ndrug of importance in the American market, one that accounts for a large flow of US dollars to \nColombia and escalating drug-related violence in the US, the Americans send a task force from \nthe DEA to Colombia to address the issue. Steve Murphy, the narrator, is partnered with Javier \nPeña. The role of Murphy's task force is to work with the Colombian authorities to put an end to \nthe flow of cocaine into the United States. \nAt the time of Murphy's arrival in Colombia, Escobar and his associates are dealing with more \nsignificant problems than the DEA. They are at war with the M-19, a revolutionary group of \nguerilla communists. W hen the M-19 kidnaps the Ochoa brothers' sister Marta, Escobar seizes \nthe opportunity to form strategic alliances with other black-marketeer criminals to establish a \ngroup called \"Death to Kidnappers\", the genesis of the Medellín cartel. His promise to his allies is \nsimple: to recover Marta Ochoa unharmed and to prevent further kidnappings. In the meantime, \nEscobar has political aspirations, as he desires to eventually become President of Colombia. He \nis elected as a congressman, but is made a fool of when proof of Escobar having criminal ties to \nthe blooming drug industry is brought. Escobar plots his revenge. \nAn extradition plan is passed in the Colombian congress, allowing for narcos to be extradited to \nthe United States when caught. This is a landmark win for Murphy, Peña, and the DEA and a \ndevastating blow to the Medellín cartel. After making successive threats to the Colombian \ngovernment to repeal the extradition plan, Escobar takes action against Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, the \nColombian Minister of Justice and a prominent lawyer in the prosecution of cartel members, by \ngunning him down in his car. Murphy and Peña are finally making progress when they catch \nEscobar's accountant, “Blackbeard”, along with a gigantic cache of incriminating evidence. The \nevidence is stored in the only place large enough and thought to have security strong enough to \nthwart any break-in attempts: the Palace of Justice. However, Escobar hires the M-19, his former \nenemies, to attack the Palace and burn all of the evidence. The DEA is left with nothing after \nEscobar's slippery move. \nIn the sixth episode, César Gaviria—the pro-extradition presidential candidate—is targeted by \nEscobar's assassins. Their plan is to blow him up whilst on Avianca Flight 203. He is saved when \nthe DEA warns the president's team of the assassination plans. Nonetheless, with the help of an \nexplosive expert from the terrorist group ETA, the plane is brought down, killing all 107 people on \nboard. The Colombian people are infuriated with the unmanageable levels of violence, especially \nthe plane bombing. The DEA also manages to track down José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, one \nof Escobar's principal associates, and violently gun him and his son Fredy down when they try to \nescape.
